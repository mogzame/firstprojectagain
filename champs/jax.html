    <img src="https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Jax_0.jpg" alt="jax-art" height="400px">
    <h2>Abilities:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong><p>Passive:</strong> INNATE: Jax's basic attacks generate a stack of Relentless Assault on-attack for 2.5 seconds, refreshing on subsequent attacks and stacking up to 8 times. Stacks expire by one every 0.25 seconds when the duration ends.</p>

            <p>RELENTLESS ASSAULT: For each stack, Jax gains 3.5% − 11% (based on level) Attack speed icon bonus attack speed, up to a maximum of 28% − 88% (based on level)</p></li>
        <li><strong>Q: </strong>ACTIVE: Jax Dash dashes to the target unit's location.</li>
        <p>
            <li><strong>W: </strong>ACTIVE: Jax empowers his next basic attack or Leap Strike Leap Strike against an enemy within 10 seconds to deal bonus magic damage. If Empower is used on a basic attack, it will gain Range icon 50 bonus range and have an Relentless Force 2 uncancellable windup.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><strong>E: </strong>ACTIVE: Jax enters Evasion for 2 seconds: a defensive stance that causes him to Jax Counter Strike old dodge all incoming non-Turret icon turret basic attacks and take 25% reduced damage from all area of effect abilities from Champion icon champions.
        </p>

            <p>Counter Strike can be recast after 1 second, and does so automatically after the duration.</p>
            
            <p>RECAST: Jax deals magic damage to nearby enemies, with the total damage increased by 20% for each attack dodged, up to a 100% increase, and Stun icon stuns them for 1 second.</p></li>

        <li>
            <p><strong>Ultimate: </strong>PASSIVE: Jax's basic attacks generate a stack of Grandmaster-At-Arms On-hit icon on-hit for 2.5 seconds, refreshing on subsequent hits and stacking up to 2 times. At 2 stacks, his next basic attack is empowered to consume them all to deal bonus magic damage. While Grandmaster-At-Arms is active, the empowered attack triggers at 1 stack instead.</p>

            <p>ACTIVE: Jax swings his lantern around, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies. If this hits a champion, he gains Armor icon bonus armor, increased for each champion hit beyond the first, and Magic resistance icon bonus magic resistance equal to 60% of that amount as well as 10% increased size for 8 seconds.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
